1. To view this prgram in python, you will need to install peewee, by typing "pip install peewee".
2. wlui.py is the work log user interface module.  Run that file to see project.
3. worklog3.py is the module that turns user responses to wlui into queries for peewee.
4. worklog3_test.py is the test module.
5. 96% of worklog3.py, 76% of wlui.py and 88% of total project covered by tests, according to my last check.
